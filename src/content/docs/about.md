## Who we are

**Yllst Testing Labs** is committed to building innovative educational tools that make learning more accessible, practical, and engaging for everyone.

We focus on developing user-friendly, interactive applications that help learners reach their goals with clarity and confidence.

## Our projects

Our first project, [iSpeakerReact ↗](https://github.com/yllst-testing-labs/ispeakerreact), is an English-learning tool built with React. It helps users improve their speaking and listening skills through interactive practice.

## Our mission

When we create tools, we keep these core values in mind:

- **Transparent**  
  We aim to clearly explain how our projects work—through readable code, meaningful commit messages, and no hidden features or proprietary algorithms.

- **Accessible & user-friendly**  
  Our tools are designed for everyone, including users who are new to computers. We follow best practices in usability and accessibility. We will try our best to implement a11y features which is related to accessibility in our projects.

- **Secure**  
  We prioritize security by keeping dependencies up to date and addressing vulnerabilities promptly.

- **Privacy-friendly**  
  We do not track, collect, or sell user data. Your data stays on your device—never on our servers.

We're always open to new ideas and feedback to help make learning better for everyone.
